Hello there,
This repository contains all my codes related to Machine Learning for different algorithms such as:

I) Regression:
* Linear Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* Polynomial Regression
* Decision Tree Regerssion
* Random Forest Regression

II) Classification
* Logistic Regression
* K Nearest Neighbour Classifer
* Naive Bayes Classifier

I will be updating the codes as and when  I keep increasing my code base.
Cheers!!
